TODO (not in this order):

• support more listing platforms
• replace GeoJSON stuff by direct GPX-reading layer
• rewrite in a more structured manner (now that I know what I’m doing);
  this is a rapid prototype to prove doability and that it works in Opera 9
• merge CGIs, possibly using AJAX (if it works in Opera 9) to make them
  into layers
• make CGIs dynamic wrt. current map boundaries (if zoom > minzoom)
• maybe CGI-using GPX import, for Opera/Konqueror who can’t do it client-side
• create user docs

Note also that this is a rapid-prototype PoC…
