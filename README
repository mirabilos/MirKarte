MirKarte
────────

This is the beta version of an experimental map application.
It is designed to show maps from various tile sources (of which
quite a number are already included), geocaches and similar
waypoints, and have advanced abilities (display coordinates
under the cursor, draw lines, draw circles around points with
a given equidistance, etc).

The current version can locally (fully client-side) import
GPX files from TerraCaching (zipped or plain) and display
the caches on the map. Support for other geocaching platforms,
geodashing, etc. may be added later.

Some advanced map functionality is not yet implemented.

This is a beta. It may break horribly and I will not be held
responsible.

If you use this, you must check the terms of use of the
various tile or WMS services yourself.
