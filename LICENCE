MirKarte currently uses togeojson for GPX import, whose licence tells us,
in no uncertain terms, to do whatever we want to.

The img/ subdirectory contains three marker icons (marker-icon-2x.png,
marker-icon.png, and marker-shadow.png) that are derived from those
provided with Leaflet (under a 2-clause BSD-style licence) and only
have the colour changed programmatically, using The GIMP.

The tc/ subdirectory contains icons that are part of the TerraCaching
website and are © Terra Interactive, LLC. These icons are proprietary
and may not be used by anyone without express permission of them.

The MirKarte accesses various online tile services. These are the
only external accesses this page does, but they may have privacy
implications as one tile layer is always loaded by default upon
page access. Furthermore, the tile and WMS services have terms of
use by themselves, which you (the MirKarte user) are required to
adhere to, and which are not covered by me (the developer of the
software known as MirKarte).
